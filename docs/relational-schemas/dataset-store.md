# Dataset Store

Sometimes the value of a specific field needs knowledge of data generated by other schemas. To solve this problem, the functions executed in the [custom fields](../fields-type/custom) and the [ref fields](../fields-type/ref) receive a store in which information from the entire dataset can be accessed.
